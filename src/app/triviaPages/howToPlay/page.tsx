        <h2>1. Creating a Trivia Game</h2>
        <p>
          Head to the '<strong>{BUTTON_LABELS.CREATE_EDIT_SHARE.title}</strong>' section on your dashboard.
          Here, you can build your own trivia game by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding categories (e.g., Music, Movies, History)</li>
          <li>Entering questions with answer choices (A, B, C, ...)</li>
          <li>Selecting the correct answer</li>
          <li>Assigning points per question (e.g., 1, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, ...)</li>
          <li>Saving your trivia for later or sharing with friends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Make sure your questions are clear and your answers accurate — this will make playing more fun!

        <h2>2. Sharing Trivias</h2>
        <p>
          After saving your trivia, it becomes available to share. Other users can find your trivia under 
          <em>{BUTTON_LABELS.PLAY_SHARED.title}</em>. Sharing enables everyone to enjoy the games you've created!

        <h2>3. Starting and Playing a Game</h2>
        <p>
          When you're ready to play:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select a trivia game from the shared list.</li>
          <li>Input the number of players (minimum {MIN_PLAYERS}, maximum {MAX_PLAYERS}).</li>
          <li>Enter each player's name — everyone should have a unique name.</li>
          <li>Begin the game, where players take turns answering questions.</li>
          <li>The current player chooses a question and tries to answer it.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>4. Scoring and Turns</h2>
        <p>
          When a player answers correctly, they earn the points assigned to that question, and the turn moves to the next player in order.
          If the answer is incorrect, the question is opened up for stealing!

        <h2>5. Stealing Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Stealing gives other players a chance to earn the points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the current player answers incorrectly, other players can attempt to steal.</li>
          <li>You can manually choose which player gets to try stealing, or it will go in order automatically.</li>
          <li>If a player steals correctly, they earn the points.</li>
          <li>After a successful steal, the next turn goes to the player after the original player who missed.</li>
          <li>If no one steals correctly, the turn moves to the next player after the original player.</li>
        </ul>
